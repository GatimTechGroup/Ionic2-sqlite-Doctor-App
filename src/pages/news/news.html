        Suicide risk elevated among lung cancer patients
      </ion-card-title>
      <p>
        According to the American Cancer Society, excluding skin cancer, lung cancer is the second most common form of cancer in the United States and the leading cause of cancer-associated death for both men and women. 
        The symptoms of lung cancer are not often noticed until it has spread throughout the lungs or to other parts of the body. Due to the lack of symptoms in the early stages, the outlook for lung cancer is not as good as some other cancer types.

        Obstructive sleep apnea might lead to irregular heartbeat
      </ion-card-title>
      <p>
      Lead author Dr. Tetyana Kendzerska, Ph.D., of the University of Ottawa in Canada, and colleagues came to their findings by analyzing the medical records of more than 8,000 adults.
      The results were recently presented at the American Thoracic Society Conference 2017, held in Washington, D.C.
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a condition characterized by pauses in breathing during sleep, due to a partial or complete blockage of the upper airway.

        Chocolate may cut risk of irregular heartbeat by a fifth
      </ion-card-title>
      <p>
        From an analysis of more than 55,000 adults from Denmark, researchers found that eating between 2 and 6 ounces of chocolate every week was associated with a 20 percent reduced risk of atrial fibrillation (A-fib).
        Lead study author Dr. Elizabeth Mostofsky, of the Department of Epidemiology at Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, MA, and colleagues recently reported their findings in the journal Heart.
        More than 2.7 million people in the United States are living with A-fib.

        Scientists identify ten new genetic variants linked to cardiac structure and function
      </ion-card-title>
      <p>
        Strong or weak, big or small - variations in our genome play a decisive part in how our heart is shaped and works. Scientists of the German Centre for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK) together with an international consortium have identified ten new genetic variants associated with cardiac structure and function. The results contribute to the understanding of the complex pattern of genetic and environmental factors that underlies cardiovascular diseases and could thus form the basis for new therapies.
